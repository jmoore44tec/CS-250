How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
- It's important to look at any potential product from the view of the user. Being able to anticipate what will be wanted or needed in an app is crucial. User stories help eliminate guess work, giving direct and actionable items to consider and implement.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
- For my own personal use I would likely focus on the third Agile principle, "[iterative], sprint working delivers customer values through continuous progress and momentum." A good habit is working gradually, in short sprints and taking necessary breaks for feedback and contemplation. One bad habit I exhibit is grinding out work until my eyes bleed (not literally of course, although I do give myself the occasional headache from missing meals by being too adamant about feeling satisfied with the amount of work I accomplish before stopping). Working in sprints and examining work as I go would greatly benefit me as well as the work I put out. When I am too focused and get sucked in, I can sometimes lose the thread and miss an important detail, unable to catch it. This is something I am actively working on.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
- Being a good team member means being able to effectively communicate, whether it be my needs or wants, or simply documenting my code. Communication is key in any group setting so having a good grasp on commmunication skills is essential. Another quality of a good team member is being open, honest, and providing mutual trust with the team. If everyone is too worried about what the other people are doing, their work will suffer.
